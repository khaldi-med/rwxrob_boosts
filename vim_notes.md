## Vim notes:
   
As I have learn from prevuies sources how to use Vim. This file is my notes to use "Vim" fast.

* to open a new file with the exiceting one use ":tabe <filename>", ant to switch between tabs, use:
	- `gt` — Switch to the tab on the right.
	- `gT` — Switch to the tab on the left2.

* Switch case to upperCase use "~" for one word. 
     - To switch the word to the right use "gUw"
     - To change multiple words, put a number in front of the commande "gU$w"
     - To change the whole line, try "gU$"

<-- .vimrc conf-->
